	---------------- minimum viable product ---------------
		
	part checkin
	
	reconize serial numbers in intake form
	
	loaner form
		jk it is now a modal... 
			need to add a selector for condition, loaded from when last checked in
			text box for estimated value, also loaded from database
				when it does not reconize the computer:
					Make and Model
					Serial Number
					
	loaner checkin
	attention items (for example if a repair is open for more than 2 months unfinished, or 2 month after finishing)
	better error messages when config or backend dies, or if the k drive is down
	does every loaner connect to a repair... If so, why do we have so many loaners out?
	
		
	easter eggs:
		when clicking on "Repa" it changes a random nice color and then goes back to what it was
		when writing a @umich.edu email it says "muck fishican"
